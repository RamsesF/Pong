# Pong Multiplayer
Pong with multiplayer, using Node.js and socket.io. Only two players, and unlimited spectators.

## What did I use
- Node.js
- Express
- Socket.io

## How to get this thing working?
1. Download my project as a ZIP.
2. UnZIP my project and paste it where you can access it easily.
3. Make sure you have npm & node.js installed. https://nodejs.org/en/ <- downloading node.js will have npm automatically
4. Open up your console/CMD and navigate to the project.
5. When you have npm installed, use "npm install" to install all my used packages.
6. When the packages are installed, use "node server.js" to get the server up and running!
7. Navigate to your IP-address with your browser, and have fun!
